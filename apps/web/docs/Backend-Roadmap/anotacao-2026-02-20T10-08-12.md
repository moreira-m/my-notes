# How Does the Internet Work?

*   The internet is **standardized**, designed to **withstand**, **underpin** services, and operate **seamlessly**.
*   The Internet is a **network of networks**.

## Key Protocols

*   **IP Protocol**: Responsible for **routing packets** to their correct destination.
*   **TCP Protocol**: Ensures packets are transmitted **reliably** and in the **correct order**.
*   **HTTP**: Used to **transfer data** between a **client** and a **server**.
    *   **HTTPS**: An **encrypted version** of HTTP.
*   **SSL/TLS**: Provides **secure communication**.

## TCP/IP Concepts

*   **Ports**
*   **Sockets**
*   **Connections**
*   **Data Transfer**

# SSL/TLS Concepts

*   **Certificates**: Used to establish **mutual trust** between the client and server.
*   **Handshake**: Client and server exchange **information** to negotiate the **encryption algorithm**.
*   **Encryption**: Data is **encrypted** using the agreed-upon algorithm.
*   As a developer, it is important to understand protocols to ensure that, in your applications, none of the **sensitive data** is going to be exposed.

# Everything You Need to Know About HTTP

*   Is a **TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol**.

## Key Characteristics / Considerations

*   Often subject to misnomers and has certain drawbacks.
*   Acknowledges its **stateless** nature.
*   Employs a **three-way handshake**.

## HTTP/1.1 Enhancements

*   Introduced **persistent connections**:
    *   Connections were not closed by default and were kept open, which allowed **multiple sequential requests**.
*   Supports **chunked transfers**.

## SPDY Protocol

*   **Core idea**: To **decrease latency** to increase **network performance**.
    *   **Latency**: Is the **delay** in data transmission.
    *   **Bandwidth**: Is the **amount of data transferred per second**.

# HTTP/2: Design for Low Latency Content Transport

## 1. Binary Protocol
*   **Easy to parse**.
*   No longer readable by human eyes.

## 2. Multiplexing
*   All streams are sent **asynchronously** through the same connection.
*   Without opening any additional connections.
*   Resulting in the server responding in the same **asynchronous way**.

## 3. Header Compression
*   Uses **Huffman code**.

## 4. Server Push
*   The server, knowing that the client is going to ask for certain resources, can **push** them to the client.
*   Without the client even asking for it.

## 5. Request Prioritization

## 6. Security
